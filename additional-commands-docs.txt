Install React Router for Navigation:
[npm install react-router-dom]

Install Grid for Layout
[npm install react-grid-layout]

Instead of Installation #2
Utilize this one instead:
npm install @material-iui/core --save

With that we need to install MUI v5 or v6:
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
If you need icons:
npm install @mui/icons-material
